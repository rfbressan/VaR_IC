  abstract = {A general methodology for modeling loss data depending on covariates is developed. The parameters of the frequency and severity distributions of the losses may depend on covariates. The loss frequency over time is modeled with a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with rate function depending on the covariates. This corresponds to a generalized additive model, which can be estimated with spline smoothing via penalized maximum likelihood estimation. The loss severity over time is modeled with a nonstationary generalized Pareto distribution (alternatively, a generalized extreme value distribution) depending on the covariates. Since spline smoothing cannot directly be applied in this case, an efficient algorithm based on orthogonal parameters is suggested. The methodology is applied both to simulated loss data and a database of operational risk losses collected from public media. Estimates, including confidence intervals, for risk measures such as Value-at-Risk as required by the Basel II/III framework are computed. Furthermore, an implementation of the statistical methodology in R is provided.},

High-frequency log-returns feature important kurtosis (fat tails) and volatility clustering (extreme log-returns appear in clusters) that VaR models should take into account. We propose a marked point process model for the excesses of the time series over a high threshold that combines Hawkes processes for the exceedances with a generalized Pareto distribution model for the marks (exceedance sizes). The conditional approach features intraday clustering of extremes and is used to calculate instantaneous conditional VaR. The models are backtested on real data and compared to a competitor approach that proposes a nonparametric extension of the classical peaks-over-threshold method. Maximum likelihood estimation is computationally intensive; we use a differential evolution genetic algorithm to find adequate starting values for the optimization process.},

Various statistical properties of asset returns are then described: distributional properties, tail properties and extreme fluctuations, pathwise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks. Our description emphasizes properties common to a wide variety of markets and instruments. We then show how these statistical properties invalidate many of the common statistical approaches used to study financial data sets and examine some of the statistical problems encountered in each case.},

  Abstract                 = {SEQUELS ARE RARELY AS good as the originals, so I approach this review of the market efflciency literature with trepidation. The task is thornier than it was 20 years ago, when work on efficiency was rather new. The literature is now so large that a full review is impossible, and is not attempted here. Instead, I discuss the work that I find most interesting, and I offer my views on what we have learned from the research on market efficiency. I. The Theme I take the market efficiency hypothesis to be the simple statement that security prices fully reflect all available information. A precondition for this strong version of the hypothesis is that information and trading costs, the costs of getting prices to reflect information, are always 0 (Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)). A weaker and economically more sensible version of the efficiency hypothesis says that prices reflect information to the point where the marginal benefits of acting on information (the profits to be made) do not exceed the marginal costs (Jensen (1978)). Since there are surely positive information and trading costs, the extreme version of the market efficiency hypothesis is surely false. Its advantage, however, is that it is a clean benchmark that allows me to sidestep the messy problem of deciding what are reasonable information and trading costs. I can focus instead on the more interesting task of laying out the evidence on the adjustment of prices to various kinds of information. Each reader is then free to judge the scenarios where market efficiency is a good approximation (that is, deviations from the extreme version of the efficiency hypothesis are within information and trading costs) and those where some other model is a better simplifying view of the world. Ambiguity about information and trading costs is not, however, the main obstacle to inferences about market efficiency. The joint-hypothesis problem is more serious. Thus, market efficiency per se is not testable. It must be},

We discuss the properties of the model, treat its estimation, and address testing its goodness-of-fit. The model is applied to the return data of two stock markets. },

The package provides a unified approach to fitting and simulating a wide variety of temporal point process or temporal marked point process models. The models are specified by an intensity function which is conditional on the history of the process. The user needs to provide routines for calculating the conditional intensity function. Then the package enables one to carry out maximum likelihood fitting, goodness of fit testing, simulation and comparison of models. The package includes the routines for the conditional intensity functions for a variety of standard point process models. The package is intended to simplify the fitting of point process models indexed by time in much the same way as generalized linear model programs have simplified the fitting of various linear models. The primary examples used in this paper are earthquake sequences but the package is intended to have a much wider applicability.},

  abstract      = {The analysis of extremes in financial return series is often based on the assumption of independent and identically distributed observations. However, stylized facts such as clustered extremes and serial dependence typically violate the assumption of independence. This has been the main motivation to propose an approach that is able to overcome these difficulties by considering the time between extreme events as a stochastic process. One of the advantages of the method consists in its capability to capture the short-term behavior of extremes without involving an arbitrary stochastic volatility model or a prefiltration of the data, which would certainly affect the estimate. We make use of the proposed model to obtain an improved estimate for the value at risk (VaR). The model is then compared to various competing approaches such as Engle and Marianelli's CAViaR and the GARCH-EVT model. Finally, we present a comparative empirical illustration with transaction data from Bayer AG, a typical blue chip stock from the German stock market index DAX, the DAX index itself and a hypothetical portfolio of international equity indexes already used by other authors.},

Our approach combines pseudo-maximum-likelihood fitting of GARCH models to estimate the current volatility and extreme value theory (EVT) for estimating the tail of the innovation distribution of the GARCH model. We use our method to estimate conditional quantiles (VaR) and conditional expected shortfalls (the expected size of a return exceeding VaR), this being an alternative measure of tail risk with better theoretical properties than the quantile. Using backtesting of historical daily return series we show that our procedure gives better 1-day estimates than methods which ignore the heavy tails of the innovations or the stochastic nature of the volatility. With the help of our fitted models we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to estimating the conditional quantiles of returns over multiple-day horizons and find that this outperforms the simple square-root-of-time scaling method.},

The models are compared for a Japanese data set for the years 1885���1980 using likelihood methods. For the best model, a change of time scale is made to investigate the deviation of the data from the model. Conventional graphical methods associated with stationary Poisson processes can be used with the transformed time scale. For point processes, effective use of such residual analysis makes it possible to find features of the data set that are not captured in the model. Based on such analyses, the utility of seismic quiescence for the prediction of a major earthquake is investigated. },

To capture the behavior of these tails, one should therefore rely on models that explicitly focus on the tails. Extreme value theory (EVT)-based models do exactly that, and in this paper, we apply both unconditional and conditional EVT models to the management of extreme market risks in stock markets. We find conditional EVT models to give particularly accurate Value-at-Risk (VaR) measures, and a comparison with traditional (Generalized ARCH (GARCH)) approaches to calculate VaR demonstrates EVT as being the superior approach both for standard and more extreme VaR quantiles.},

The task is thornier than it was 20 years ago, when work on efficiency was rather new. The literature is now so large that a full review is impossible, and is not attempted here. Instead, I discuss the work that I find most interesting, and I offer my views on what we have learned from the research on market efficiency. I. The Theme I take the market efficiency hypothesis to be the simple statement that security prices fully reflect all available information. A precondition for this strong version of the hypothesis is that information and trading costs, the costs of getting prices to reflect information, are always 0 (Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)). A weaker and economically more sensible version of the efficiency hypothesis says that prices reflect information to the point where the marginal benefits of acting on information (the profits to be made) do not exceed the marginal costs (Jensen (1978)). Since there are surely positive information and trading costs, the extreme version of the market efficiency hypothesis is surely false. Its advantage, however, is that it is a clean benchmark that allows me to sidestep the messy problem of deciding what are reasonable information and trading costs. I can focus instead on the more interesting task of laying out the evidence on the adjustment of prices to various kinds of information. Each reader is then free to judge the scenarios where market efficiency is a good approximation (that is, deviations from the extreme version of the efficiency hypothesis are within information and trading costs) and those where some other model is a better simplifying view of the world. Ambiguity about information and trading costs is not, however, the main obstacle to inferences about market efficiency. The joint-hypothesis problem is more serious. Thus, market efficiency per se is not testable. It must be},

The results indicate that EVT-based VaR estimates are more accurate at higher quantiles. According to estimated Generalized Pareto Distribution parameters, certain moments of the return distributions do not exist in some countries. In addition, the daily return distributions have different moment properties at their right and left tails. Therefore, risk and reward are not equally likely in these economies.},

The main emphasis of the study has been given to Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and to evaluate how well Conditional EVT model performs in modeling tails of distributions and in estimating and forecasting VaR measures. We have followed McNeil and Frey's (2000) two stage approach called Conditional EVT to estimate dynamic VaR. In stage 1, we model the conditional volatility of each series using an appropriate asymmetric GARCH model which serves to filter the return series such that the asymmetric GARCH residuals are closer to iid than the raw return series. In stage 2, we apply EVT to model the fat tails of the asymmetric GARCH residuals. We have compared the accuracy of Conditional EVT approach to VaR estimation with other competing models. The best performing model is found to be the Conditional EVT for the entire sample. To confirm whether the Conditional EVT would still be the best for a sub-period, we have compared the forecasting accuracy for the sub-sample of bull market. Here too the Conditional EVT maintains its superiority even more precisely. Since the Conditional EVT approach clearly dominates other competing models in terms of VaR forecasting, we would advocate the use of the model when managing tail related market risk in such equity markets.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we analyze the accuracy of the copula-GARCH and Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) models for forecasting the value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) of bivariate portfolios. We then try to answer two questions: First, does the correlation-based DCC model outperform the copula models? Second, how can the optimal model for forecasting portfolio risk be identified via in-sample analysis? We address these questions using an extensive empirical study of 1,500 bivariate portfolios containing data on stocks, commodities and foreign exchange futures. Furthermore, we propose to use linear discriminant analysis estimated from descriptive statistics on bivariate data samples as independent variables to identify a parametric model yielding optimal portfolio VaR and ES estimates. In particular, we try to answer the question whether the quality of a parametric model's VaR and ES estimates is driven by common data characteristics. The results show that the proposed use of linear discriminant analysis is superior to both the Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion and several copula goodness-of-fit tests in terms of overall classification accuracy. Furthermore, the results show that the quality of the DCC model's VaR and ES estimates is positively correlated with the portfolio marginals' volatility, while the opposite is true for the elliptical copulas. For the Archimedean copulas in particular, the excess kurtosis of the marginals has a significant positive influence on quality of the VaR and ES estimates.},

In statistics, extremes of a random process refer to the lowest observation (the minimum) and to the highest observation (the maximum) over a given time-period. Extreme value theory gives some interesting results about the distribution of extreme returns. In particular, the limiting distribution of extreme returns observed over a long time-period is largely independent of the distribution of returns itself. In financial markets, extreme price movements correspond to market corrections during ordinary periods, and also to stock market crashes, bond market collapses or foreign exchange crises during extraordinary periods. An approach based on extreme values to compute the VaR thus covers market conditions ranging from the usual environment considered by the existing VaR methods to the financial crises which are the focus of stress testing. Univariate extreme value theory is used to compute the VaR of a fully aggregated position while multivariate extreme value theory is used to compute the VaR of a position decomposed on risk factors.},

  abstract      = {Abstract We study the performance and behavior of Value at Risk measures used by a number of large U.S. banks before, during and after the financial crisis. Alternative benchmark VaR measures, including GARCH-based measures, are estimated directly from the banks’ trading revenues to explain the bank VaR performance results. While overly conservative in both the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, bank VaR exceedances were excessive and clustered in the crisis period. This contrasted with mostly unbiased benchmark HS and GARCH VaRs in the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, and vastly superior GARCH-based VaR performance in the crisis period with lower exceedance rates and no exceedance clustering. Our results document the bank VaRs very slow adjustment to changing market conditions and their systematic bias in all studied periods. Our results indicate that bank VaRs could be improved by the use of models with time-varying volatility, and built on banks’ knowledge of their current positions.},

  abstract      = {In recent years, the trading accounts at large commercial banks have grown substantially and become progressively more diverse and complex. We provide descriptive statistics on the trading revenues from such activities and on the associated Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts internally estimated by banks. For a sample of large bank holding companies, we evaluate the performance of banks trading risk models by examining the statistical accuracy of the VaR forecasts. Although a substantial literature has examined the statistical and economic meaning of Value-at-Risk models, this article is the first to provide a detailed analysis of the performance of models actually in use.},

  abstract  = {The  various  tools  for  risk  measurement  and  management,  especially
for  value-at-risk  (VaR),  are  compared,  with  special  emphasis  on
Japanese   market   data.   Traditional   Generalized   Autoregressive
Conditional  Heteroskedasticity  (GARCH)-type  methods  are  com-
pared  to  extreme  value  theory  (EVT).  The  distribution  of  extremes,
asymmetry, clustering, and the dynamic structure of VaR all count as
criteria  for  comparison  of  the  various  methods.  We  find  that  the
GARCH  class  of  models  is  not  suitable  for  VaR  forecasting  for  the
sample data, due to both the inaccuracy and the high volatility of the
VaR forecasts. In contrast, EVT forecasting of VaR resulted in much
better VaR estimates, and more importantly, the EVT forecasts were
considerably  more  stable,  enhancing  their  practical  applicability  for
Japanese market risk forecasts.},
