  Abstract                 = {Intraday Value-at-Risk (VaR) is one of the risk measures used by market participants involved in high-frequency trading. High-frequency log-returns feature important kurtosis (fat tails) and volatility clustering (extreme log-returns appear in clusters) that VaR models should take into account. We propose a marked point process model for the excesses of the time series over a high threshold that combines Hawkes processes for the exceedances with a generalized Pareto distribution model for the marks (exceedance sizes). The conditional approach features intraday clustering of extremes and is used to calculate instantaneous conditional VaR. The models are backtested on real data and compared to a competitor approach that proposes a nonparametric extension of the classical peaks-over-threshold method. Maximum likelihood estimation is computationally intensive; we use a differential evolution genetic algorithm to find adequate starting values for the optimization process.},

We first discuss some general issues common to all statistical studies of financial time series. Various statistical properties of asset returns are then described: distributional properties, tail properties and extreme fluctuations, pathwise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks. Our description emphasizes properties common to a wide variety of markets and instruments. We then show how these statistical properties invalidate many of the common statistical approaches used to study financial data sets and examine some of the statistical problems encountered in each case.},

  Abstract                 = {Les cumulants d'une distribution sont d{\'{e}}finis et leurs relations avec les moments ordinaires sont indiqu{\'{e}}es. On insiste sur l'importance de ces fonctions dans la description des distributions. La fonction sym{\'{e}}trique d'un {\'{e}}chantillon fini d'observations dont la valeur moyenne est {\'{e}}gale au cumulant correspondant de la population est d{\'{e}}fini et une expression convenable pour son {\'{e}}valuation est d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}}e en termes de sommes de puissances des observations de l'{\'{e}}chantillon. Les propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}s op{\'{e}}ratives des cumulants sont discut{\'{e}}es et le d{\'{e}}veloppement de l'int{\'{e}}grale des probabilit{\'{e}}s d'une distribution ayant des cumulants donn{\'{e}}s en est d{\'{e}}riv{\'{e}}. Ce d{\'{e}}veloppement est transform{\'{e}} en une expression plus commode, qui donne la valeur des d{\'{e}}viations correspondant {\`{a}} un niveau donn{\'{e}} de probabilit{\'{e}}, en fonction de la d{\'{e}}viation normale ayant la m{\^{e}}me int{\'{e}}grale des probabilit{\'{e}}s. Les valeurs num{\'{e}}riques des polyn{\^{o}}mes dans la d{\'{e}}viation normale consid{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}s dans le dernier d{\'{e}}veloppement sont calcul{\'{e}}s pour certains niveaux choisis de probabilit{\'{e}}. De plus, les valeurs num{\'{e}}riques des 5 premiers polyn{\^{o}}mes d'Hermite sont donn{\'{e}}s pour les m{\^{e}}mes niveaux de probabilit{\'{e}}. Un exemple de l'emploi des formules d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}}es est donn{\'{e}} par le calcul de la valeur approximative de z pour le niveau de probabilit{\'{e}} de 5 p.cent.},

  Abstract                 = {SEQUELS ARE RARELY AS good as the originals, so I approach this review of the market efflciency literature with trepidation. The task is thornier than it was 20 years ago, when work on efficiency was rather new. The literature is now so large that a full review is impossible, and is not attempted here. Instead, I discuss the work that I find most interesting, and I offer my views on what we have learned from the research on market efficiency. I. The Theme I take the market efficiency hypothesis to be the simple statement that security prices fully reflect all available information. A precondition for this strong version of the hypothesis is that information and trading costs, the costs of getting prices to reflect information, are always 0 (Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)). A weaker and economically more sensible version of the efficiency hypothesis says that prices reflect information to the point where the marginal benefits of acting on information (the profits to be made) do not exceed the marginal costs (Jensen (1978)). Since there are surely positive information and trading costs, the extreme version of the market efficiency hypothesis is surely false. Its advantage, however, is that it is a clean benchmark that allows me to sidestep the messy problem of deciding what are reasonable information and trading costs. I can focus instead on the more interesting task of laying out the evidence on the adjustment of prices to various kinds of information. Each reader is then free to judge the scenarios where market efficiency is a good approximation (that is, deviations from the extreme version of the efficiency hypothesis are within information and trading costs) and those where some other model is a better simplifying view of the world. Ambiguity about information and trading costs is not, however, the main obstacle to inferences about market efficiency. The joint-hypothesis problem is more serious. Thus, market efficiency per se is not testable. It must be},

The model is developed within the framework of the peaks-over-threshold approach in extreme value theory and relies on a Poisson process with self-exciting intensity. We discuss the properties of the model, treat its estimation, and address testing its goodness-of-fit. The model is applied to the return data of two stock markets. },

The package provides a unified approach to fitting and simulating a wide variety of temporal point process or temporal marked point process models. The models are specified by an intensity function which is conditional on the history of the process. The user needs to provide routines for calculating the conditional intensity function. Then the package enables one to carry out maximum likelihood fitting, goodness of fit testing, simulation and comparison of models. The package includes the routines for the conditional intensity functions for a variety of standard point process models. The package is intended to simplify the fitting of point process models indexed by time in much the same way as generalized linear model programs have simplified the fitting of various linear models. The primary examples used in this paper are earthquake sequences but the package is intended to have a much wider applicability.},

The models are compared for a Japanese data set for the years 1885���1980 using likelihood methods. For the best model, a change of time scale is made to investigate the deviation of the data from the model. Conventional graphical methods associated with stationary Poisson processes can be used with the transformed time scale. For point processes, effective use of such residual analysis makes it possible to find features of the data set that are not captured in the model. Based on such analyses, the utility of seismic quiescence for the prediction of a major earthquake is investigated. },

  abstract      = {SEQUELS ARE RARELY AS good as the originals, so I approach this review of the market efflciency literature with trepidation. The task is thornier than it was 20 years ago, when work on efficiency was rather new. The literature is now so large that a full review is impossible, and is not attempted here. Instead, I discuss the work that I find most interesting, and I offer my views on what we have learned from the research on market efficiency. I. The Theme I take the market efficiency hypothesis to be the simple statement that security prices fully reflect all available information. A precondition for this strong version of the hypothesis is that information and trading costs, the costs of getting prices to reflect information, are always 0 (Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)). A weaker and economically more sensible version of the efficiency hypothesis says that prices reflect information to the point where the marginal benefits of acting on information (the profits to be made) do not exceed the marginal costs (Jensen (1978)). Since there are surely positive information and trading costs, the extreme version of the market efficiency hypothesis is surely false. Its advantage, however, is that it is a clean benchmark that allows me to sidestep the messy problem of deciding what are reasonable information and trading costs. I can focus instead on the more interesting task of laying out the evidence on the adjustment of prices to various kinds of information. Each reader is then free to judge the scenarios where market efficiency is a good approximation (that is, deviations from the extreme version of the efficiency hypothesis are within information and trading costs) and those where some other model is a better simplifying view of the world. Ambiguity about information and trading costs is not, however, the main obstacle to inferences about market efficiency. The joint-hypothesis problem is more serious. Thus, market efficiency per se is not testable. It must be},

The main emphasis of the study has been given to Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and to evaluate how well Conditional EVT model performs in modeling tails of distributions and in estimating and forecasting VaR measures. We have followed McNeil and Frey's (2000) two stage approach called Conditional EVT to estimate dynamic VaR. In stage 1, we model the conditional volatility of each series using an appropriate asymmetric GARCH model which serves to filter the return series such that the asymmetric GARCH residuals are closer to iid than the raw return series. In stage 2, we apply EVT to model the fat tails of the asymmetric GARCH residuals. We have compared the accuracy of Conditional EVT approach to VaR estimation with other competing models. The best performing model is found to be the Conditional EVT for the entire sample. To confirm whether the Conditional EVT would still be the best for a sub-period, we have compared the forecasting accuracy for the sub-sample of bull market. Here too the Conditional EVT maintains its superiority even more precisely. Since the Conditional EVT approach clearly dominates other competing models in terms of VaR forecasting, we would advocate the use of the model when managing tail related market risk in such equity markets.},

We then try to answer two questions: First, does the correlation-based DCC model outperform the copula models? Second, how can the optimal model for forecasting portfolio risk be identified via in-sample analysis? We address these questions using an extensive empirical study of 1,500 bivariate portfolios containing data on stocks, commodities and foreign exchange futures. Furthermore, we propose to use linear discriminant analysis estimated from descriptive statistics on bivariate data samples as independent variables to identify a parametric model yielding optimal portfolio VaR and ES estimates. In particular, we try to answer the question whether the quality of a parametric model's VaR and ES estimates is driven by common data characteristics. The results show that the proposed use of linear discriminant analysis is superior to both the Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion and several copula goodness-of-fit tests in terms of overall classification accuracy. Furthermore, the results show that the quality of the DCC model's VaR and ES estimates is positively correlated with the portfolio marginals' volatility, while the opposite is true for the elliptical copulas. For the Archimedean copulas in particular, the excess kurtosis of the marginals has a significant positive influence on quality of the VaR and ES estimates.},
